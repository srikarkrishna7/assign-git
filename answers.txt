• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Git does a fast-forward when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead of the one you have checked-out.

• Why should you have different branches?
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others giving them an easy option to work individually. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
    You can have as many origin you need but can have only remote origin, as it is a default remote created by git.
